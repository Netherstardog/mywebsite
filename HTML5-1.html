 <h3>Sanibel Island is an island that is right off the coast of Florida and is 33.16 square miles. Sanibel Island is connected to Florida by a very long, man made bridge. The reason I love Sanibel Island is because of the Sanibel-Captiva Conservation Foundation, which prevents commercial growth and too much development on the island. The only chain restaurants on the island are Dairy Queen and Subway. Sanibel Island also set the limit of buildings to 2 to 3 stories tall, so you don't have a bunch of skyscrapers blocking the view. The wildlife there is enormous. More than half the island is made of wildlife refuges and the biggest one is the J.N. Ding Darling National Wildlife Refuge. The most relaxing thing there though, is just sitting on the beach and hearing the waves go back and forth.</h3>
