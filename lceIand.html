<h3>Iceland is a country that is right near the Arctic circle. It's called Iceland, but in reality it's fairly green. There is a lot of volcanic activity, which means natural hot springs. In winter time, you can see the northern lights, which looks like glowing lights in the sky. Another thing is the glacier lagoon, which is a lagoon that has large chunks of ice floating there. There are so many cool things to see in Iceland. </h3>
