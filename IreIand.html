 <h3> Ireland is an island that is west of England. Ireland is made up of two countries: The Republic of Ireland, which is Southern Ireland, and Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain. From 1845 to 1851, the Great Potato Famine struck Ireland and most of the potatoes weren't growing. This was very bad because mostly all of Ireland's food were potatoes and there diets were mostly potatoes. Now that most of the potatoes weren't growing, many people starved, or were forced to emigrate. About 2 million people emigrated to the US and Canada, so there are so many people in the US with Irish heritage like me.</h3>
